# python-agridata

Python wrapper for the European Commission AgriData API.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carazzolo/python-agridata.git
cd python-agridata
pip install .
```

The package depends only on `requests`, which is installed automatically.

## Usage

The API is synchronous. Create a service instance and call the available endpoints:

```python
from agridata.service import AgriDataService

service = AgriDataService()
prices = service.cereal.get_prices(memberStateCodes="IT", marketingYears="2024")
print(prices)
```

## Available services

Each product category exposes different services. The table below lists the
currently supported products and their services as defined by the official API.

| Product | Services |
|---------|---------|
| beef | prices, categories, productCodes, production, production/categories |
| liveAnimal | prices, categories |
| pigmeat | prices, cuts/prices, cuts/categories, cuts/priceTypes, cuts/prices/month, cuts/prices/month/categories, cuts/prices/month/priceTypes, production |
| poultry | prices, priceTypes, prices/month, prices/month/priceTypes, egg/prices, egg/farmingMethods, production, production/animals |
| sheepAndGoat | prices, categories, markets, production, production/meats, production/items |
| rawMilk | prices, products |
| dairy | prices, products, production, production/categories |
| cereal | prices, products, stages, markets, production, production/crops |
| rice | prices, stages, types, varieties, memberStates, production, production/types, production/products |
| oilseeds | prices, products, productTypes, markets, marketStages, production, production/crops, crops/prices, crops/products, crops/productTypes, crops/marketStages |
| sugar | prices, regions, production, production/regions |

| cmefIndicators | values, types, categories, indicators, subIndicators, parameters, units, codes, sources |
| fertiliser | prices, prices/products |
| organic | prices, sectors, organicProducts, overallProducts |
All query classes accept a common set of parameters used when calling the API:
`memberStateCodes`, `categories`, `productCodes`, `marketingYears`, `weeks`, `months`,
`beginDate` and `endDate`.

## Examples and tests

Example scripts live in the `examples/` folder and are intentionally minimal.
They rely only on Python's standard library and this package. Any previous
demonstrations that used thirdâ€“party tools like pandas or matplotlib have been
removed to keep the examples lightweight. After cloning the repository you can
run a script with:

```bash
python examples/<example_name>.py
```

For a quick demonstration run the `basic_usage.py` script:

```bash
python examples/basic_usage.py
```

### Running tests

The project uses `pytest` for its test suite. From the repository root simply
run:

```bash
pytest
```
